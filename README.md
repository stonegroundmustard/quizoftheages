## Description

This challenge was started with the intention to build an interactive timed quiz to learn about local storage and API's. This posed quite a few mental road blocks for me when it came to the JSON statments and local storage functions. Learning through trial and error (and quite a few online resources/tutor sessions) I would say it was a success!

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

Start the quiz using the start button, then hover over the correct answers and click through. Your score will be displayed at the end with the option to save you score with your name into local storage.
